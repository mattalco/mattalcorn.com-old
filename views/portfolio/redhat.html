                    Red Hat Marketplace (RHM) was created to be a single store for all of your development needs. RHM
                    was a curated catalog of OpenShift compatible software that could be easily browsed, purchased,
                    deployed, and managed from a single combined web experience.

                <p>
                    I was a senior member of a squad that we called "Discovery & Console" as we were responsible for the
                    main homepage, product pages, search, and software management pages of Red Hat Marketplace. We were
                    a group of frontend and design specialists made up of developers, UX designers, and a product
                    manager. </p>

            <h3> MARKET LANDING PAGE </h3>
            <div class="col-md-12">
                <p>The Market Landing Page (MLP) was designed to immerse the user into our catalog of products allowing them to easily see what products were offered with large clickable tiles. We also made callouts to things like the blog and actions for starting a trial to increase engagement.</p>

            <div class="col-md-12">
                <p>Our Search page offered quick access to the entire catalog and allowed users to filter products based on the product's categories and other features.</p>

            <div class="col-md-12">
                <p>Our product details page (PDP) was created to showcase all the features and capabilities of a product in one easy to navigate page. Product features and capabilities appeared in the left rail with the product's description and accompanying videos and images appearing front and center.</p>

            <div class="col-md-12">
                <p>Also on the PDP was the product's pricing info. We showed all versions of the product in easy to compare cards that allowed users to quickly start a trial or configure and purchase an offering.</p>

            <div class="col-md-12">
                <p>Our Documentation page was built for any user at any experience level. Categories and easy to access sections allowed users to quickly jump to whatever their interests were - whether that was setting up an account or reviewing technical details on deploying an operator purchased from the store.</p>
